# üìö Additional Features Implemented
## 1. UI Styling: ShadCN with TailwindCSS

   ### ShadCN: 
   Utilized ShadCN components to provide consistent, modern UI elements for dropdown menus, buttons, and avatars. ShadCN components were customized with TailwindCSS for a responsive and flexible layout.
   
   ### TailwindCSS: 
   TailwindCSS was used for utility-first styling, ensuring fast, efficient, and customizable design. It helps with creating responsive layouts and enhancing the user experience.

## 2. Local Storage: Persistence of Cart and Authentication State

   ### Cart Persistence: 
   Used LocalStorage to persist the shopping cart state even after the page reloads. Each user's cart is associated with their unique user ID. The cart data is stored under a key like cart_<userId>,   ensuring that each   user sees their own cart data.
   ### User Authentication: 
   The current user‚Äôs authentication state is also stored in LocalStorage under the key currentUser. This allows users to remain logged in across page reloads.
   On login/logout, the relevant data (cart and authentication state) is managed in LocalStorage, so the user's cart and session persist even after refreshing the browser.

## 3 Search and Filter Products

   ### Search Functionality: 
   A search bar was added to filter products by name. Users can type into the search bar, and the product list will dynamically update to show matching results.
   ### Filter by Category: 
   Additional filters were implemented for products, allowing users to filter by category. This enhances the product browsing experience, especially in cases with a large number of products.
